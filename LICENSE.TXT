This license states what you can and cannot do with any piece of code written by Project Ice ('us', 'we'). If you break any term laid down in this license, you may not continue to use any of Project Ice's code in any form (source, compiled or packaged).

You may:
	- Download and use our Minecraft mods to play without restriction.

	- Use our Minecraft mods in any modpack, provided that:
		a) You make it clear to any user of the pack which of our mods is in your pack and that they are written by us.
		b) You do not make any money with the modpack. This includes adverts and URL shorteners such as Adfly.

	- Make any money using our code. This includes adverts and URL shorteners such as Adfly.

	- Claim that you wrote any of our code. We put a lot of work into what we do, and it makes us sad to see it taken away from us. :(

Any (and I mean any) of the above may be changed or waived without notice by a Project Ice owner.
Project Ice and all members thereof cannot be held liable for any damages regarding Project Ice code. If something goes fatally wrong, it's not our fault.
